# 👋 Hi, I'm Tamar | Data Analyst for Revenue & Retention

I am a revenue-focused data analyst transitioning from 15+ years in sales, banking, and customer operations into hands-on analytics and **predictive modeling**.

After two decades of driving commercial performance in organizations like **Bank of Georgia** and **Extra.ge**, I now apply **SQL**, **Python**, and **Machine Learning** to systematically analyze revenue shifts, customer behavior, and financial risk.

### 🧰 Technical Stack
- **Languages:** SQL (CTEs, Window Functions), Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy)
- **Analytics & ML:** Predictive Modeling, Unsupervised Learning (Clustering), Statistical testing (p < 0.05), RFM & Cohort analysis
- **Tools:** Tableau, Git, Pytest

### 📊 Selected Projects

#### 🔹[Revenue Forensics & Churn Modeling](https://github.com/tamari-javakhishvili/revenue-forensics-churn-analysis)
- Identified structural AOV decline in a high-value segment (**€301 → €61**)
- Developed an **ML-based churn prediction model** (Random Forest, **AUC 0.81**)
- Quantified **€562K revenue-at-risk** for targeted intervention

#### 🔹 [E-Commerce Revenue Collapse Analysis](https://github.com/tamari-javakhishvili/ecommerce-revenue-collapse-analysis)
- Investigated an **85% revenue decline** across global markets
- Applied **Unsupervised Learning (K-Means)** to detect hidden retention failures
- Flagged highest-risk market (Germany) for AI-driven reactivation strategy

### 🎯 What I Care About
I believe **Machine Learning** should support **decisions, not just dashboards**. Key questions I work to answer:
- **Why** is revenue changing?
- **Which** high-value customers are at risk (Predictive Insights)?
- **Where** is financial exposure emerging in the pipeline?
